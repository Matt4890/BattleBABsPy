Music files must be 44.1kHz .ogg files. Any other file extension will be ignored, and non 44.1kHz sampled audio
will likely not play at the correct speed.

If you do not have such files they can be easily made using the free software Audacity by following these steps

1) open your audio file in audacity
2) Change the project rate to 44100Hz (most likely a drop down menu in the bottom left of the window)
3) Goto File->Export->Export as OGG
4) Export your audio

Your audio is now in a 44.1kHz OGG file format and can be placed into this music directory
